Kopitiam Maths is a youth movement to foster national mathematics interest among students.

We are young students dedicated to provide free (no-ads), high-quality videos about mathematics. We want to present maths in a lively and engaging manner with interesting visuals and rich content. Ultimately, we aspire to be a one-stop channel for Malaysian students to prepare for their Mathematics and Additional Mathematics exams.

We use manim to animate our videos. Check out the [3b1b library](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) and the [manim community library](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim/).

## Contributing
April 2021: We appreciate any contributions, but currently we are still starting out. For now, we thank you very much if you let more people know about this movement. Other contributions we welcome is making subtitles for the videos in Malaysian languages (Malay, Chinese, Tamil etc.).
